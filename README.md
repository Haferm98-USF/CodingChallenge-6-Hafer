# CodingChallenge-6-Hafer
A small business wants to manage its employee shift schedules. They need a system that: 1. Tracks employees and their assigned shifts. 2. Checks employee availability based on their existing shifts. 3. Assigns new shifts to available employees. 4. Calculates the total hours worked by each employee for the week.

Purpose of the assignment:
Create and manipulate objects and arrays in JavaScript.
Use array methods like find(), forEach(), and reduce() for operations on employee data.
Use control structures to check conditions and handle edge cases (like checking availability before assigning shifts).
Use GitHub for version control and demonstrate professional coding practices.
